I'm Hannah, a Ph.D. student and NLM Predoctoral Fellow in the Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI) program at the [University of Washington](http://bime.uw.edu/) since 2018. My advisor is [Trevor Cohen](http://bime.uw.edu/faculty/trevor-cohen/). I also work with [Bill Lober and the Clinical Informatics Research Group (CIRG)](https://www.cirg.washington.edu/), [Reza Hosseini Ghomi and the DigiPsych Lab](http://www.rezahosseinighomi.com/about.html), and [Kari Stephens](https://escience.washington.edu/people/kari-stephens/).
I am interested in clinical informatics, especially clinical decision support and predictive analytics; mobile health; distributional representations and semantics; mental health informatics; and data science and machine learning for all things BHI.
